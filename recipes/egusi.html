    <p>
      Egusi soup is native to West Africa (Nigeria), and many of my American and
      Nigerian friends have enjoyed it. It is a great soup for those who like to
      try something different every once in a while. Ground Egusi seeds give
      this soup a unique color and flavor. If you can't find Egusi seeds, you
      can substitute pumpkin seeds. Any combination of crab, shrimp, and smoked
      fish can be used in place of the shrimp. Drained, smoked oysters and
      chicken can be used in place of the beef.

    <h2>Fiery Fusion: Spicy Chicken Noodle Delight</h2>

    <p>
      No matter what recipe they're used in, rice noodles are a proven
      crowd-pleaser. I think this spicy chicken noodles dish is perfect for
      using up leftover chicken, assuming it wasn't horribly overcooked in the
      first place. If you did want to use raw chicken, go ahead and chop it up,
      and stir-fry it for a minute or two before adding your vegetables.
